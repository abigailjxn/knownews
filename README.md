# Know News

An app that scrapes NBC's Asian America, populates article links and allows the user to comment and view comments.

## Technology Used
- UI Kit (CSS Framework)
- Handlebars (templating)
- Axios (JQuery functionality for the backend)
- Cherrio (scrapes the website for data)
- Express (middleware)
- MongoDB (database)
- Mongoose (for querying Mongo)
- Morgan (route logger)

## Issues

It will only display the most recent comment on the article. I wasn't sure how to populate multiple comments since the value returned through Mongo wasn't an array.
